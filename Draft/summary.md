### Can synapses be characterized by their gene expressions?
*Jesse Patsolic*

#### Opportunity

Currently, there have not been analyses 
conducted to characterize synapse type with regard to gene expression
information [USS].  There have been RNA based classifications, 
and methods based on spatial patterning and location of axons and
dendrites, see [eLife] and [NAT] respectively. 
Although, the literature in certain areas can be dense with information,
it can be lacking in completeness and varying in terminology [eLife]. This
creates a challenge and opportunity for creation of a work flow to 
solidify the subsequent inferences made of the available data.  

#### Significance

The classification of synapse types could lead to countless discoveries
in neurological disorders including autism, dementia, addiction,
anxiety disorders, and epilepsy [JPHY].  This is by no means a comprehensive
list, however, it gives a picture of the far reaching consequences 
that insights into synapse composition would have.   To highlight one 
in the list above, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized 
by "impaired reciprocal social interactions, 
deficits in language acquisition, and repetitive and restricted 
behaviours and interests" [JPHY].  According to the NIH, about 1 in 
every 68 eight-year old children was identified as having ASD, in 
a 2010 study [NIHaut].

#### Feasibility
Data processing and image analysis have been greatly improved with
advances in computing.  
Various methods of analysis will yield whether or not a significant
difference between synapse types can be detected, given the
resolution of the data and features measured.  We expect to come to
a conclusion and, if that conclusion is favorable, present a
classification of synapses.  Potential complications could arise in the
classification step, yielding undefined clusters.  Effort will be taken
to attempt multiple classification and feature extraction methods. 

#### Innovation

If results prove promising, the methods and classifications developed
would be the first of their kind:  Enabling much to be added to the
current understanding of synapse structure, research and possible
treatments.
